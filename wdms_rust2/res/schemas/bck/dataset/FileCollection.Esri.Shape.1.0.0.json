  "description": "A dataset representing a shapefile format, i.e. a collection of files with specific extensions. A shapefile is a geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software. It is developed and regulated by Esri as a mostly open specification for data interoperability among Esri and other GIS software products. The shapefile format can spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing, for example, water wells, rivers, and lakes. Each item usually has attributes that describe it, such as name or properties. The role of the files in the collection is identified by the standard file extension, e.g. '.dbf', '.shp', '.shx', etc.",

Augmentation examples: 1) The designated CRS identified by CoordinateReferenceSystemID can be an early BoundCRS providing the selected transformation to WGS 84. 2) If the dataset represents 3-dimensional coordinates, the VerticalCoordinateReferenceSystemID provides the vertical reference. 3) If no vertical CRS is defined, the vertical unit is given by PersistableReferenceUnitZ."
