The 'MasterData' array is processed second (if populated) second. The 'Data' structure is processed last (if populated). Inside the 'Data' property the 'Datasets' array is processed first, followed by the 'WorkProductComponents' array, the 'WorkProduct' is processed last. Any arrays are ordered. should there be interdependencies, the dependent items must be placed behind their relationship targets, e.g. a master-data Well record must placed in the 'MasterData' array before its Wellbores.",
