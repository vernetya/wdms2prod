The name 'AsIngestedCoordinates' was chosen to contrast it to 'OriginalCoordinates', which carries the uncertainty whether any coordinate operations took place before ingestion. In cases where the original CRS is different from the as-ingested CRS, the AppliedOperations can also contain the list of operations applied to the coordinate prior to ingestion. The data structure is similar to GeoJSON FeatureCollection, however in a CRS context explicitly defined within the AbstractAnyCrsFeatureCollection. The coordinate sequence follows GeoJSON standard, i.e. 'eastward/longitude', 'northward/latitude' {, 'upward/height' unless overridden by an explicit direction in the AsIngestedCoordinates.VerticalCoordinateReferenceSystemID}.",

This derived coordinate representation is intended for global discoverability only.
