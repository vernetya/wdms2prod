  "description": "A well log is a data type that correlates a particular measurement or multiple measurements in a wellbore against depth and/or time within that wellbore. When plotted visually, well logs are typically long line graphs (called \"curves\") but may sometimes be discrete points or intervals. This schema object is intended for digital well logs, not raster log files or raster calibration files, but may be used for the latter in the absence of a defined OSDU schema for these use cases.",
