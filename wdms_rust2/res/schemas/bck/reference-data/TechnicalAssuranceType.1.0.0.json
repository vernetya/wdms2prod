Clarifications: Since Certified is the highest classification of suitable quality, any further change or versioning of a Certified record should be carefully considered and justified. If a Technical Assurance value is not populated then one can assume the data has not been evaluated or its quality is unknown  (=Unevaluated). Technical Assurance values are not intended to be used for the identification of a single \"preferred\" or \"definitive\" record by comparison with other records.",
