However, quantities of the same dimension are not necessarily of the same class. The term \"unit quantity class\" is intended to have the same general  meaning as the term \"kind of quantity\" as defined by the  \"International vocabulary of meteorology - Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)\" (JCGM 200:2008) https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf.",
