  "description": "IndexableElement follows the RESQML pattern. IndexableElement is used to 1) contain geometry within a representation, 2) attach properties to a representation, 3) identify portions of a representation when expressing a representation identity, and 4) construct a sub-representation from an existing representation. Several specialized indexable elements, e.g., hinge node faces, have been included to add higher order geometry to a grid representation, and are not available for other purposes.",
