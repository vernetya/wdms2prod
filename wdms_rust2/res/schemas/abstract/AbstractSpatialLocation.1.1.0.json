The data structure is similar to GeoJSON FeatureCollection, however in a CRS context explicitly defined within the AbstractAnyCrsFeatureCollection. The coordinate sequence follows GeoJSON standard, i.e. 'eastward/longitude', 'northward/latitude' {, 'upward/height' unless overridden by an explicit direction in the AsIngestedCoordinates.VerticalCoordinateReferenceSystemID}.",
