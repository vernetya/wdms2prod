A facility is a grouping of equipment that is located within a specific geographic boundary or site and that is used in the context of energy-related activities such as exploration, extraction, generation, storage, processing, disposal, supply, or transfer. Clarifications: (1) A facility may be surface or subsurface located. (2) Usually facility equipment is commonly owned or operated. (3) Industry definitions may vary and differ from this one. This schema fragment is included by Well, Wellbore, Rig, as well as Tank Batteries, Compression Stations, Storage Facilities, Wind Farms, Wind Turbines, Mining Facilities, etc., once these types are included in to the OSDU.",
